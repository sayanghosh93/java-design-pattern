# java-design-pattern

I'm trying to learn OOPS Design Pattern. Since I'm comfortable in Java, I chose Java as implementation. In my opinion I could
use the concepts of this tutorial to other Object Oriented Languages as well if I ever need to.

Here's the link to the tutorial I'm following for now. I may add few more links later.
